# Portfolio

## Assignments

	This folder contains assignments completed during my time at the University of Guelph. The first is an assignment written in Cobol and the second is a math based encryption assignment with some python scripting.

## Hobbies
	This folder contains examples of my CAD/3D printing work in addition some of the photography work I've done. All of the cad files included were moddelled by myself. The first file is a foregrip for an airsoft marker. The next a corner joint for my boss, he works on play sets and this allows him to build and deconstruct set pieces quickly. The next is a Go Pro cover I designed that you can finish with an extra piece of plexiglass, it is a friction fit. The final is a snow blower key I designed for my dad who lost his. All were printed at .15-.2mm layer height on a Creality CR-10.

## Papers
	I have included two papers. The first (FinalComputationPaper) was my final paper for my Computational Intelligence class in my final year of University, it explains the application of deep learning in the mental health field. The second was a group paper for a Security class I took that was recently published by our professor. 


## Website
	This contains two webpage examples, the first (matthewjblatz) was a website made from a bootstrap template in University. It was used to outline what I learned during my co-op terms so if you would like my duties and responsibilities during my co-op time explained those are available on the site. The second is a test I recently completed for another company's interview process. The task was to replicate a webpage to their specifications.
