                    <p>    During my first co-op term I was working for 5 months for CCS (Computing and Communications Services) at the University of Guelph. CCS provides a variety of services at the University such as, IT support, telephonic communications, and access to the single sign-on that we have on campus. At CCS our main goal was to provide quality and uninterrupted internet service to the University of Guelph campus. We have many different departments on campus each with their own specific role such as, Network Infrastructure, IT Security, and Managed Desktops. Network Infrastructure is in charge of setting up and maintaining internet connections around campus, IT Security deals with security concerns and copyright infringement, and Managed Desktops does in person IT Support for specific departments. Based on the size of the tasks these departments vary in size from 2 people to 12 and are located in many different buildings around campus including Johnson Hall where I did the majority of my work.  CCS is incredibly accommodating for students and allows their co-op employee to continue employment during their study periods. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Description Of My Position</h2>

                    <p>During my time at CCS I worked with the IT Support Team. Providing IT support requires a general understanding of basic hardware and software issues as well as communication and people skills to provide friendly service. We fielded requests over phone, email, and in person from the entire University campus as well as Guelph-Humber and Ridgetown campuses. My daily duties were  ensure each issue was resolved and well documented for future reference. To start the day I would respond to as many email requests as possible before opening the phone queue. The requests we received over email were very similar to the ones we got over the phone, the main reason some people choose email requests over phone was to send links as well as screenshots. During the slower periods at the help centre co-op students would be entrusted with project work. A couple of the projects I worked on included updating the CCS directory page that we used in the office, creating standard operating procedures for some of the more common tasks, and checking documents and webpages for errors. Another requirement of the position was to attend bi-weekly after work meetings. During these meetings we discussed what types of issues were most common, any changes in the way issues were to be handled, and discussed how to streamline our operation with a workplace efficiency expert. I took this job because I have some previous IT support experience and it was a great introduction to a business environment.</p>

					<h2 class="section-heading">Goals</h2>
					<p><b>Explanation Of Ideas: </b>Before working for CCS I had done a small amount IT work for clients, friends, and family. During that time it was always hard to explain what the problem was to people who havenâ€™t had access to technology their entire life. By working at the CCS Help Centre I wanted to work on explaining technical issues in more straightforward and basic terms. I used simple language and analogies to help explain more complex ideas and double checking with the clients to make sure they understand. By the end of my work term I felt that I had fewer clients requesting me to re-explain myself. </p>
					<p><b>Telephonic Communication: </b>Communicating over a telephone has been my weakest form of communication by far. I find I slip up in conversation a lot more over the phone than in person.     As part of the everyday of the job I spent hours on the phone. I took my time on the phone to keep a level head and make sure the ideas I was delivering to the client was clear and concise. I found the more thought I put into the call and the way I spoke the more collected the conversation sounded. While I did not completely resolve the issue I feel I made good progress. </p>
					<p><b>Understanding A Business Environment: </b>Before starting this placement I had little to zero interaction with a professional business environment as all of my jobs have been general labour or other similar work I was a little behind on which departments in the University handle different things. I wanted to work on this by asking  for help less and more for confirmation. By phrasing my requests this way I would have to do more on my own and therefore learn quickly. Currently I am more informed on departmental duties and usually can send tasks to other departments without confirmation.</p>
					<h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
					<p>In conclusion, I believe my time at CCS was very well spent. It helped to develop a greater understanding of the business environment as well as helping to connect with a lot of important people in the University of Guelph. I gained experience in client relations as well as dealing with common software bugs and troubleshooting. The customer service side of computer science is one that is often overlooked, developers have to ensure that the clients needs are met and they are satisfied with the product. While this is not exactly what the position was, I was able to catch a glimpse of it and the experience will be very helpful in the future. </p>
